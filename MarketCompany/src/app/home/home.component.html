            <h4> <b> <u> Stock Market: </u></b> </h4>
            Stock market is a place where people buy/sell shares of publicly listed companies.
            <br>
            It offers a platform to facilitate seamless exchange of shares.
            <br>
            In simple terms, if A wants to sell shares of Reliance Industries,
            <br> the stock market will help him to
            meet the seller who is willing to buy Reliance Industries. 
            <br>
            However, it is important to note that a
            person can trade in the stock market only through a registered intermediary known as a stock broker. The
            buying and selling of shares take place through electronic medium. We will discuss more about the stock
            brokers at a later point.
            <br>
            <h4><b><u>Stock Exchanges in India:</u></b></h4>
            There are two main stock exchanges in India where majority of the trades take place 
            <br>
            - Bombay Stock
            Exchange (BSE) and
            the National Stock Exchange (NSE). Apart from these two exchanges,
            <br>
             there are some other regional stock exchanges like Bangalore Stock Exchange,
            Madras Stock Exchange etc but these exchanges do not play a meaningful role anymore.
